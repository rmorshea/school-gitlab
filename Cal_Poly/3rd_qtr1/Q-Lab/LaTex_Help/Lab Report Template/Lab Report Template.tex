\section{Introduction}

Radiation physics and chemistry flourished at the end of the 20th century; Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen made his sensational discovery of X rays in 1895 and it was soon followed by Henri Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity and by J. J. Thomson?s proof of the independent existence of negative electrons of small mass. Then Marie and Pierre Curie discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium, and Paul Villard made the first detailed observations of gamma rays. Though Paul Villard is almost forgotten today by the scientific community. He is given credit for having discovered gamma rays, but that discovery is almost never discussed in any detail. He stands, one might say, in the shadow of giants.

It was on May 18$^{th}$ that Villard demonstrated that radium emits rays which are non-deviable under the influence of magnetic fields and are capable of penetrating dense objects. These new rays, said Villard, were different from the radium rays observed so far. He went on to suggest that the extremely penetrating rays, were similar to the X rays previously observed by Rontgen and thus he claimed they were a kind of X ray.

This paper uses the penetrating capabilities of gamma rays which were first observed by Villard to determine the mass attenuation coefficient for lead and aluminum.
